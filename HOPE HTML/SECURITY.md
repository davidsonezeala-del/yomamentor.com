# Security Policy

This document explains how to report security vulnerabilities affecting the Yomamentor one-page site and what to expect after a report is received.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Email: Sales@yomamentor.com
- Include: affected URL(s), proof-of-concept or steps to reproduce, impact, and an optional contact for follow-up.
- If you prefer encrypted submissions, request our public PGP key via the same email and we'll provide it.

Do not include sensitive data (passwords, private keys) in your initial report.

## Scope

- In-scope: code and assets in this repository (HTML, CSS, JS), contact form handling, and publicly reachable pages served from this site.
- Out-of-scope: third-party services (Calendly, Formspree, Netlify, GitHub) and private infrastructure not included in this repo.

## Response & Disclosure Policy

- Acknowledgement: within 72 hours of receipt.
- Triage and fix plan: within 7 calendar days, or earlier for critical issues.
- Coordination: we prefer coordinated disclosure. We will work with reporters to verify and remediate before public disclosure.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against security researchers acting in good faith who follow the reporting guidance above.

## Remediation

- Fixes will be applied to the repository and deployed to the live site as appropriate. For critical issues, we will prioritize hotfixes.

## Contact

Sales@yomamentor.com — preferred initial contact for security reports and follow-up.
